tx-isolation
----------------------
problem domain:
    1. write lost
    2. read dirty
    3. non-repeatable read
        a. virtual read: same row, different data (update)
        b. phantom read: same read, different row (insert)

resolve: isolation level
    1. serializable
        not allow concurrent
    2. repeatable read
        allow phantom read, not allow virtual read
    3. read uncommitted
        allow phantom and virtual read
